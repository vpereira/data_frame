DataFrame is a flexible container for Matlab/R style data analysis in Ruby.

Its API is still at a very early stage of development.

Examples and motivation: http://www.lukasbiewald.com/?p=112

Git codebase: http://github.com/dolores/data_frame

Unfortunately the RDoc generation is somewhat broken at the moment, otherwise it would be published here: http://dataframe.rubyforge.org.
